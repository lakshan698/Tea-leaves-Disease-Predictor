A machine learning-based web application designed to detect tea leaf diseases and provide actionable fertilizer/remedy recommendations in both **Sinhala** and **English**. This project aims to help tea planters identify diseases early and treat them effectively using both organic and chemical methods.

##  Here How It Looks!!!
